# Mushroom-Classification
## The main idea of the project is to build a solution that should be able to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.
# Projct Overview
## Exploratory Data Analysis is done and Feature Importance is determined. 
## Summary of AU-ROC and Accuracy scores for test set for 5 different Classification Models is given
## XGBoost, Random Forest and Decision Tree models are giving us best Accuracy and AU-ROC score
